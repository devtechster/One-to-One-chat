Sure, here's a combined Markdown file describing the whole project:

### Project Description

This project is a simple peer-to-peer (P2P) messenger application implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to exchange messages in real-time using a P2P communication approach facilitated by the Bugout library.

#### Files and Functionality:

1. **addMessage.html:**
   - This file presents a form for users to input messages and a message board to display those messages dynamically. It includes JavaScript functionality to handle message submission and display.

2. **class.html:**
   - The `class.html` file implements a P2P messenger application using JavaScript classes and the Bugout library. It defines a `ChatRoom` class to encapsulate the chat functionality, including sending and receiving messages.

3. **index.html:**
   - Serving as the main entry point, `index.html` provides a user interface for the P2P messenger application. It includes form elements for message input and display areas for received messages. The file initializes the application and handles message sending and receiving.

4. **snippets.html:**
   - `snippets.html` contains various JavaScript code snippets demonstrating different concepts such as data types, objects, arrays, functions, variable scopes, and more. It also includes queries related to JavaScript concepts.

5. **variableScope.html:**
   - Demonstrating different scopes of variables in JavaScript, `variableScope.html` showcases global scope, function-local scope, and block-local scope using `var` and `let` declarations.

#### JavaScript Libraries:

- The project utilizes the Bugout library (`bugout.min.js`) to facilitate P2P communication between browsers.

#### Project Structure and Notes:

- The project comprises multiple HTML files, each demonstrating different aspects of JavaScript and web development.
- JavaScript is used extensively for handling user interactions, sending and receiving messages, and demonstrating various language features and concepts.
- HTML and CSS are utilized for structuring the user interface and styling elements.
- Each HTML file provides distinct functionality or demonstrations related to JavaScript and web development concepts.

This project serves as a learning resource for understanding P2P communication, JavaScript classes, variable scopes, and other fundamental concepts in web development.
